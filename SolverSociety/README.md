# SolverSociety

My first project in Solver Society, held by IYKRA, is about Agriculture. 
In this project, We create a rice import prediction using multiple linear regression model. 

Through this project, we want to know what factors affect rice imports and get a model to predict the amount rice imports in Indonesia
